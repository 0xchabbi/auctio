# Component Library Specification

This document details the core components for the Auctio web and mobile apps. Components should be built in Figma with variants for state management and responsive behavior. Use Auto Layout, constraints, and design tokens defined in the UI/UX concept.

## Buttons
| Variant | Usage | States | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | High-emphasis actions like "Jetzt mitbieten" | default, hover, focus, pressed, disabled | Gradient background, white text, drop shadow `0 12px 24px rgba(255,90,60,0.25)` |
| Secondary | Supporting actions like "Zur Wunschliste" | default, hover, focus, pressed | `brand-secondary` outline, transparent fill |
| Tertiary | Text button links | default, hover | Use `brand-secondary` text, underline on hover |
| Icon | Quick actions (favorite, share) | default, hover, active | 44px circle, 2px stroke icons |

## Navigation
### Top App Bar (Web)
- Left: logo, "Auctio" wordmark.

- Scroll behavior: elevate with shadow after 16px scroll.

### Bottom Navigation (Mobile)
Tabs: Home, Suchen, Verkaufen (accented), Alerts, Profil. Use dynamic badges for alerts.
